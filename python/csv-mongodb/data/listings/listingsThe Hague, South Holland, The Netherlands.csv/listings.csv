I really enjoy the Netherlands as my adopted home country and have no plans to return to the US other than for visits.

On a personal level, I have three daughters 25 , 30 and 44 with the two youngest growing up in the Netherlands and attending Dutch schools. 

Two of the three lived in the US : Washington DC and New York ( but now Marseille)  

My 30 year old moved first back to Holland 8 years ago , then Brussels and now Helsinki and is active in the environmental movement .

My oldest owns a home in Williamsburg, Brooklyn ( now living in Marseille) and founded an environmental NGO 14+ years ago ( Human Impacts Institute) and has a  5 year old daughter.

Lastly my youngest moved to DC 2 years ago after graduating 5 years ago from College of Charleston with high honors in International relations and political science. 

You wouldn't be wrong to deduce that I'm quite proud of these three lovely ladies.

As for myself, I have traveled a lot over the last 40 + years for both work and pleasure and really enjoy meeting people so when I first heard of Airbnb almost 13  years ago, the concept of Airbnb appealed to me.

On a personal level, I have had an interesting career in high-tech international sales management. In my pleasure time I have quite varied interests but I am very much an outdoors person. I enjoy sailing, tennis, biking, camping, skiing etc. and I am as well a classical musician and a world class tournament bridge player. 

I have always loved to travel and meet people and have been doing just that since my teenage years when I hitchhiked with hair to my waist, a biker jacket and a backpack from Washington DC to San Francisco in the middle of the Hippy Era 1971 . ... can't say I regret it !!

Back to the present: 

I renovated my 3 bedroom flat in Centrum Den Haag 15 years ago when my two then teenage daughters still lived in the Netherlands and spent weekends with me. 

I then set up the two small bedrooms in my 3 bedroom flat with bunk beds to accomodate friends staying over.

Before I began hosting through Airbnb,  I occasionally rented  out a room to interns/foreign students and now have been hosting for the last 12 years through Airbnb. 

Hosting with Airbnb has been overall a very interesting and rewarding experience. 

I have found almost without exception my Airbnb guests from all over the world and from very differing backgrounds to be very interesting , considerate and nice to be around.

As you are now reading my profile, I hope that you will consider staying at my flat and I  look forward to welcoming you to my home and my adopted city of Den Haag.

I really enjoy the Netherlands as my adopted home country and have no plans to return to the US other than for visits.

On a personal level, I have three daughters 25 , 30 and 44 with the two youngest growing up in the Netherlands and attending Dutch schools. 

Two of the three lived in the US : Washington DC and New York ( but now Marseille)  

My 30 year old moved first back to Holland 8 years ago , then Brussels and now Helsinki and is active in the environmental movement .

My oldest owns a home in Williamsburg, Brooklyn ( now living in Marseille) and founded an environmental NGO 14+ years ago ( Human Impacts Institute) and has a  5 year old daughter.

Lastly my youngest moved to DC 2 years ago after graduating 5 years ago from College of Charleston with high honors in International relations and political science. 

You wouldn't be wrong to deduce that I'm quite proud of these three lovely ladies.

As for myself, I have traveled a lot over the last 40 + years for both work and pleasure and really enjoy meeting people so when I first heard of Airbnb almost 13  years ago, the concept of Airbnb appealed to me.

On a personal level, I have had an interesting career in high-tech international sales management. In my pleasure time I have quite varied interests but I am very much an outdoors person. I enjoy sailing, tennis, biking, camping, skiing etc. and I am as well a classical musician and a world class tournament bridge player. 

I have always loved to travel and meet people and have been doing just that since my teenage years when I hitchhiked with hair to my waist, a biker jacket and a backpack from Washington DC to San Francisco in the middle of the Hippy Era 1971 . ... can't say I regret it !!

Back to the present: 

I renovated my 3 bedroom flat in Centrum Den Haag 15 years ago when my two then teenage daughters still lived in the Netherlands and spent weekends with me. 

I then set up the two small bedrooms in my 3 bedroom flat with bunk beds to accomodate friends staying over.

Before I began hosting through Airbnb,  I occasionally rented  out a room to interns/foreign students and now have been hosting for the last 12 years through Airbnb. 

Hosting with Airbnb has been overall a very interesting and rewarding experience. 

I have found almost without exception my Airbnb guests from all over the world and from very differing backgrounds to be very interesting , considerate and nice to be around.

As you are now reading my profile, I hope that you will consider staying at my flat and I  look forward to welcoming you to my home and my adopted city of Den Haag.

Ik ben geboren in Oekraïne en ben trots op mijn moederland. Sinds 16 jaar geleden woon ik in Nederland (ingeschreven op november 2015) en ben dol op de mogelijkheden die dit (ik noem het mijn) vaderland aan mensen kan bieden. Vriendelijkheid, hardwerkende mentaliteit en discipline spreken me erg aan in Nederland. Ik hou even veel van die 2 prachtige landen.

WELKOM
In mijn huis voel je je gelijk op je gemak. Voel je je thuis en vergeet niet dat je op bezoek bent is mijn motto.

HET KOKEN IN HUIS OF BUITEN HUIS OM ETEN
Het delen van keuken en eetkamer gaat hier in samenwerking met elkaar. Ik kook op vaste tijdstippen: vaak om 17:00 uur. De tijd er voor of er na kan gebruikt worden voor het bereiden van je eigen maaltijd. Het halen van een lekker buitenlands gerecht is hier makkelijk te doen. Grieks, Perzisch, Turks (Istanbul), Chinees, Indisch (Ramna), Italiaans, Japans, Surinaams, Afrikaans en natuurlijk Nederlands eten is hier vaak op 5 minuten loopafstand / makkelijk te vinden.

KOFFIE EN THEELIEFHEBBERS
Voor koffieliefhebbers is Florencia (Italian Icecream) voor de deur. Coffie Company is weer te vinden op 250 meter loopafstand van huis terwijl Boon (koffiebranderij) met verschillende soorten koffie uit verschillende landen  zich op maar 50 meter loopafstand bevindt. Het bezoeken van Lola Bikes & Coffee aan het Noordeinde zorgt zonder meer voor een onvergetelijke ervaring. 
Natuurlijk kan je ook een bakkie koffie thuis zetten met Bialetti Moka Induction mokapot voor 3 kops. Zowel koffie als thee is gratis voor gebruik. 

AUTO PARKEREN
Voor mensen die laat komen of het te druk hebben met hun planning kan geheel kosteloos een bezoekers parkeerkaart gebruikt worden. Deze kaart heeft een beperkt aantal uren dus voor mensen met meer tijd is er mogelijkheid om hun auto ook gratis te parkeren op 15 minuten loopafstand van mijn huis met uitzicht op leuke bezienswaardigheden zoals Vredespaleis, Anna Paulona-straat, Koninklijke stallen en de Paleistuin.

Ik ben geboren in Oekraïne en ben trots op mijn moederland. Sinds 16 jaar geleden woon ik in Nederland (ingeschreven op november 2015) en ben dol op de mogelijkheden die dit (ik noem het mijn) vaderland aan mensen kan bieden. Vriendelijkheid, hardwerkende mentaliteit en discipline spreken me erg aan in Nederland. Ik hou even veel van die 2 prachtige landen.

WELKOM
In mijn huis voel je je gelijk op je gemak. Voel je je thuis en vergeet niet dat je op bezoek bent is mijn motto.

HET KOKEN IN HUIS OF BUITEN HUIS OM ETEN
Het delen van keuken en eetkamer gaat hier in samenwerking met elkaar. Ik kook op vaste tijdstippen: vaak om 17:00 uur. De tijd er voor of er na kan gebruikt worden voor het bereiden van je eigen maaltijd. Het halen van een lekker buitenlands gerecht is hier makkelijk te doen. Grieks, Perzisch, Turks (Istanbul), Chinees, Indisch (Ramna), Italiaans, Japans, Surinaams, Afrikaans en natuurlijk Nederlands eten is hier vaak op 5 minuten loopafstand / makkelijk te vinden.

KOFFIE EN THEELIEFHEBBERS
Voor koffieliefhebbers is Florencia (Italian Icecream) voor de deur. Coffie Company is weer te vinden op 250 meter loopafstand van huis terwijl Boon (koffiebranderij) met verschillende soorten koffie uit verschillende landen  zich op maar 50 meter loopafstand bevindt. Het bezoeken van Lola Bikes & Coffee aan het Noordeinde zorgt zonder meer voor een onvergetelijke ervaring. 
Natuurlijk kan je ook een bakkie koffie thuis zetten met Bialetti Moka Induction mokapot voor 3 kops. Zowel koffie als thee is gratis voor gebruik. 

AUTO PARKEREN
Voor mensen die laat komen of het te druk hebben met hun planning kan geheel kosteloos een bezoekers parkeerkaart gebruikt worden. Deze kaart heeft een beperkt aantal uren dus voor mensen met meer tijd is er mogelijkheid om hun auto ook gratis te parkeren op 15 minuten loopafstand van mijn huis met uitzicht op leuke bezienswaardigheden zoals Vredespaleis, Anna Paulona-straat, Koninklijke stallen en de Paleistuin.

Because of the location for instance: the sea close to your doorstep and you can reach historical cities like Amsterdam, Leiden, Delft, Gouda, Haarlem and Alkmaar within an hour by car or public transport.

Now some of my children have left the house, I enjoy hosting people and making them feel home in this same atmosphere.

Every morning I try to make time to go to the forest to get a taste of the clean and fresh air in nature. Thanks to the location of our house it is also possible to visit the beach very easily. Sunshine or stormy weather: the sea is always a beauty to me!

I like to cook, read and love nature, but religion is most important to me. Religion and prayer gives me strength to do my daily tasks with passion and joy.

Hopefully we will meet soon.

If that is a bit too much for you, no worries, the wine store including a wonderful small pottery will get you another sort of souvenir (which you can get rid of a bit more easily if you wish so).<br /><br />The bicycle shop across the street will rent you your preferred means of typical Dutch<br />transportation.

Art Deco is the predominant architectural style. Its elegant buildings have a height limitation of ten meters, which makes the skyline of the city visible from any point.

I studied Architecture due to its fusion with the humanist legacy of a perennial art. After graduating, I realised that high-end customer service was the exact key I needed to manage my future professional prospects, so once settled in Europe I decided to pursue and MBA in International Hospitality in the world-prestigious Hotel School The Hague.

I speak fluently five languages; I have the Cambridge Proficiency certificate in English. Spanish is my mother tongue. I am fluent in Portuguese as well. I studied French for two years, and given my Italian background, I also master the language. I am currently in a super intensive Dutch course.

I have extensive experience working in management positions for nine large multinational companies: InterContinental, Wyndham, Salomon, Hard Rock Cafe, Coldwell Banker, Royal Caribbean Int., Hertz, Louis Vuitton and MSC Cruises.

One day we lay at the beach and read a book the other day we visit a nice place and eat the local food. 
First we try the beers then we try the wine.

Ik ben geboren in Oekraïne en ben trots op mijn moederland. Sinds 16 jaar geleden woon ik in Nederland (ingeschreven op november 2015) en ben dol op de mogelijkheden die dit (ik noem het mijn) vaderland aan mensen kan bieden. Vriendelijkheid, hardwerkende mentaliteit en discipline spreken me erg aan in Nederland. Ik hou even veel van die 2 prachtige landen.

WELKOM
In mijn huis voel je je gelijk op je gemak. Voel je je thuis en vergeet niet dat je op bezoek bent is mijn motto.

HET KOKEN IN HUIS OF BUITEN HUIS OM ETEN
Het delen van keuken en eetkamer gaat hier in samenwerking met elkaar. Ik kook op vaste tijdstippen: vaak om 17:00 uur. De tijd er voor of er na kan gebruikt worden voor het bereiden van je eigen maaltijd. Het halen van een lekker buitenlands gerecht is hier makkelijk te doen. Grieks, Perzisch, Turks (Istanbul), Chinees, Indisch (Ramna), Italiaans, Japans, Surinaams, Afrikaans en natuurlijk Nederlands eten is hier vaak op 5 minuten loopafstand / makkelijk te vinden.

KOFFIE EN THEELIEFHEBBERS
Voor koffieliefhebbers is Florencia (Italian Icecream) voor de deur. Coffie Company is weer te vinden op 250 meter loopafstand van huis terwijl Boon (koffiebranderij) met verschillende soorten koffie uit verschillende landen  zich op maar 50 meter loopafstand bevindt. Het bezoeken van Lola Bikes & Coffee aan het Noordeinde zorgt zonder meer voor een onvergetelijke ervaring. 
Natuurlijk kan je ook een bakkie koffie thuis zetten met Bialetti Moka Induction mokapot voor 3 kops. Zowel koffie als thee is gratis voor gebruik. 

AUTO PARKEREN
Voor mensen die laat komen of het te druk hebben met hun planning kan geheel kosteloos een bezoekers parkeerkaart gebruikt worden. Deze kaart heeft een beperkt aantal uren dus voor mensen met meer tijd is er mogelijkheid om hun auto ook gratis te parkeren op 15 minuten loopafstand van mijn huis met uitzicht op leuke bezienswaardigheden zoals Vredespaleis, Anna Paulona-straat, Koninklijke stallen en de Paleistuin.

When travelling for work or for pleasure, I cherish home-feeling places and thoughtful local hosts.  As a guest, I will take care of your place as if it were mine. 

Because of my travels I have learned about cross-cultural hospitality. And I put all that into my hosting, in Mexico and The Hague. 

I know Mexico City very well and will give you great tips. My shared place is open to respectful individuals. The room in the lovely art deco apartment in Mexico City can allow you to live the Mexican Chilango life in a chic, or also in a down to earth way. Your choice, because that is what you will find in Condesa. 
In The Hague you will be in a unique location connected just bordering the gorgeous historical center, within the international organisations and Embassies sector, with a 10 min drive to the beach Scheveningen, North and  Zuid beaches and close to the exits of the city to visit the Randstaad and the surrounding Dutch countryside. 

We speak English, French, Dutch and of course Spanish.

I love landscapes, architecture, cities and their inhabitants in all their local varieties. I travel often for teaching, design & surveys of landscape architecture and for my pleasure with family. As traveler I either chose characteristic small hotels or book myself at private house via AirBnB and others.
Starting from my own architecture developments I am renting out since 2008.
I am your host in 3 very different architect’s houses on AirBnB with local hosts Billie & Lova,  Kurt, Sang, Justine, Paul & Andreea. 
Landscape Achitects Chalet Pigniu in Switzerland is my own design built in 2004 with DGJ Architektur and local builders. 
Landscape Architects Hofje is a former printshop housing in The Hague. It was refurbished by an architect-couple who lived there until i bought it as my private residence in 2015. In 2022 we finally got permission to rent 30 nights per year.
In Zurich i rent a dream rooftop lofty I designed it for myself but now rather stay with my wife elsewhere and with my children below. As a professional designer of living environments and sideways host I like to get inspired from other people's way of hospitaliy in an authentic manner to improve our own. As a traveler I never look for „best practice“ or , worse „standard“ properties - which you will probably also not find at those homes of mine. 
Until 2019 I was an estate manager of urban boutique estates Parques Guesthouses. In Kralingen Rotterdam 2014 and Rietberg Zürich 2016 we provided 8 rooms each in typical local family townhouse or apartment until 2019. They where managed by my former business partner Mascha and we had up to 7 extra staff.
